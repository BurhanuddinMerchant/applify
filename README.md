## Getting Started

**Please ensure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your system**

1.  Create a .env file (using the example.env file as a reference)

this will bring up the entire application

To bring down the application, you need to run:

The Frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3000

The APIs will be accessible at http://localhost:8000

You can access the django admin panel at: http://localhost:8000/admin
